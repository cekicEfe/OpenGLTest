If you are reading this I assume you demand some kind of explanation about classes 
Here they are :

in model dir :
Model.h is responsible for entity models there are no animation support (for now of course)
Camera.h is responsible for camera objects
Shader.h is responsible for shader objects
Vertex.h is just a dependece of Model.h ALONG WITH BUFFERS which I will explain later

in buffers dir : 
All header files in this dir are just buffers and created dynamicly I will explain this in mainhandler and renderFunctor
Tryng to learn how they work are completly useless unless you know how they work so dont bother them
